### How add other languages posts

* Fork the watchiot-docs repo
* Into the _config.yaml
* Edit ```languages: ["en", "es"]``` adding the new lanaguage, example add "fr" ```languages: ["en", "es", "fr"]```
* Into the i18n folder make a new folder called *fr*
* Into the *fr* folder copy and paste the same files into the folder *i18n/en*
* Then only you have to edit the posts using the new language.
* The last step is add *fr* into the selector view language into the file *_includes/post.html*
 
```html
<div class="post">
    {% if site.lang == "en" %}
    {% capture link %}{{ site.baseurl_root }}/es{{ page.url}}{% endcapture %}
    <div align="right">
        <a href="{{ link }}" >{% t global.spanish %}</a><span class="separator"> &bull; </span>
    </div>
    {% elsif site.lang == "es" %}
    {% capture link1 %}{{ site.baseurl_root }}{{ page.url  }}{% endcapture %}
    <div align="right">
        <a href="{{ link1 }}" >{% t global.english %}</a><span class="separator"> &bull; </span>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Here you new language selector -->
    
    {% endif %}
